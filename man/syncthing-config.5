.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Syncthing uses a single directory to store configuration, crypto keys
and index caches. The location defaults to \fB$HOME/.config/syncthing\fP
(Unix\-like), \fB$HOME/Library/Application Support/Syncthing\fP (Mac),
\fB%AppData%/Syncthing\fP (Windows XP) or \fB%LocalAppData%/Syncthing\fP
(Windows 7+). It can be changed at runtime using the \fB\-home\fP flag. In this
directory the following files are located:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBconfig.xml\fP
The configuration file, in XML format.
.TP
.B \fBcert.pem\fP, \fBkey.pem\fP
The device\(aqs RSA public and private key. These form the basis for the
device ID. The key must be kept private.
.TP
.B \fBhttps\-cert.pem\fP, \fBhttps\-key.pem\fP
The certificate and key for HTTPS GUI connections. These may be replaced
with a custom certificate for HTTPS as desired.
.TP
.B \fBindex\-\fP\fI*\fP\fB\&.db\fP
A directory holding the database with metadata and hashes of the files
currently on disk and available from peers.
.TP
.B \fBcsrftokens.txt\fP
A list of recently issued CSRF tokens (for protection against browser cross
site request forgery).

.SH SYNCING CONFIGURATION FILES
.sp
Syncing configuration files between devices (such that multiple devices are
using the same configuration files) can cause issues. This is easy to do
accidentally if you sync your home folder between devices. A common symptom
of syncing configuration files is two devices ending up with the same Device ID.
.sp
If you want to use Syncthing to backup your configuration files, it is recommended
that the files you are backing up are in a folder\-master to prevent other
devices from overwriting the per device configuration. The folder on the remote
device(s) should not be used as configuration for the remote devices.
.sp
If you\(aqd like to sync your home folder in non\-master mode, you may add the
folder that stores the configuration files to the ignore list\&.
If you\(aqd also like to backup your configuration files, add another folder in
master mode for just the configuration folder.
